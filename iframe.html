      <h3><b>First Computer <i>'Virus'</i></b></h3>
    </section>

    <p>The first computer virus was called creeper and was created in <i>1971</i>.</p>
    <p>Creeper was an experimental computer program written by <b>Bob Thomas</b> in <i>1971</i>. It was designed to move
      between mainframe computers system, with a later version by <b>Ray Tomlinson</b> designed to copy itself between
      computers rather than simply move.</p>
    <p>This self-replicating version of Creeper is generally accepted to be the first computer worm. Creeper was a test
      created to demonstrate the possibility of a self-replicating computer program that could spread to other
      computers.</p>
    <p>The program was not actively malicious software as it caused no damage to data, the only effect being a message
      it output to the teletype reading <b>"I'M THE CREEPER : CATCH ME IF YOU CAN"</b></p>
    <p>Reaper was the first anti-virus software, designed to delete Creeper by moving across the computers. It was
      created by <b>Ray Tomlinson</b> in <i>1972</i>.</p>

      <h3><b>Space War</b></h3>
    </section>
    <p>The first computer game was called <b>Spacewar!</b> and was created in 1962.
    <p><b>Spacewar!</b> is a space combat video game developed in <i>1962</i> by <i>Steve Russell</i> in collaboration
      with <i>Martin Graetz, Wayne Wiitanen, Bob Saunders, Steve Piner, and others</i>. It was written for the newly
      installed <b>DEC PDP-1</b> minicomputer at the <b>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</b>. After its initial
      creation, <b>Spacewar!</b> was expanded further by other students and employees of universities in the area,
      including <i>Dan Edwards</i> and <i>Peter Samson</i>. It was also spread to many of the few dozen installations of
      the <b>PDP-1</b> computer, making <b>Spacewar!</b> the first known video game to be played at multiple computer
      installations. </p>
    <p><b>Spacewar!</b> is one of the most important and influential games in the early history of video games. It was
      extremely popular in the small programming community in the <i>1960</i>s and the public domain code was widely
      ported to and recreated on other computer systems at the time, especially after computer systems with monitors
      became more widespread towards the end of the decade. </p>
    <p>It directly inspired many other video games, such as the first commercial arcade video games, Galaxy Game and
      Computer Space (<i>1971</i>), and later games such as <b>Asteroids</b> (<i>1979</i>). </p>

    <p>The first computer mouse was <b>invented in 1964</b> and was made of wood.</p>
    <p>The first public demonstration of a mouse controlling a computer system was done by <b>Doug Engelbart</b> in <b>1968</b> as part of the <i>Mother of All Demos</i>.</p>
    <p>Mice originally used two separate wheels to directly track movement across a surface: one in the x-dimension and one in the Y. Later, the standard design shifted to use a ball rolling on a surface to detect motion, in turn connected to internal rollers. Most modern mice use optical movement detection with no moving parts.</p>

      <h3>30 Ton Computer?!</h3>
    </section>

    <p>
      The first electronic computer weighed more than <b>30 tons</b>. 
</p>

<p>
      <b>ENIAC</b> was the first programmable, electronic,
      general-purpose digital computer, completed in <b>1945</b>. 
</p>

<p>
      <b>ENIAC</b> was a large, modular computer, composed of individual panels to perform different functions. Twenty of these
      modules were accumulators that could not only add and subtract, but hold a ten-digit decimal number in memory.
      Numbers were passed between these units across several general-purpose buses (or trays, as they were called). In
      order to achieve its high speed, the panels had to send and receive numbers, compute, save the answer and trigger
      the next operation, all without any moving parts. Key to its versatility was the ability to branch; it could
      trigger different operations, depending on the sign of a computed result. 
</p>

<p>
      It weighed more than <b>30 short tons (27 t)</b>, was roughly <b>8 ft (2 m)</b> tall, <b>3 ft (1 m)</b> deep, and <b>100 ft (30 m)</b> long,
      occupied <b>300 sq ft (28 m2)</b> and consumed <b>150 kW</b> of electricity. 
</p>

<p>
      <b>ENIAC</b> used common octal-base radio tubes of the day. 
</p>

<p>
      Several tubes burned out almost every day, leaving <b>ENIAC</b> nonfunctional about half the time. Special
      high-reliability tubes were not available until <b>1948</b>. Most of these failures, however, occurred during the warm-up
      and cool-down periods, when the tube heaters and cathodes were under the most thermal stress. Engineers reduced
      <b>ENIAC's</b> tube failures to the more acceptable rate of one tube every two days. According to an interview in 1989
      with <b>Eckert</b>, "We had a tube fail about every two days and we could locate the problem within 15 minutes."In
      <b>1954</b>, the longest continuous period of operation without a failure was <b>116 hours</b>—close to five days.

      <h3> First Harddrive</h3>
    </section>
    <p>
      The first hard disk drive had a capacity of <b>5 megabytes</b> and was the size of a refrigerator. 
</p>

<p>
      The first production <b>IBM hard disk drive</b>, the <b>350 disk storage</b>, shipped in <b>1957</b> as a component of the <b>IBM 305
      RAMAC system</b>. It was approximately the size of two large refrigerators and stored <b>five million six-bit characters
      (3.75 megabytes)</b> on a stack of <b>52 disks (100 surfaces used)</b>. The <b>350</b> had a single arm with two read/write
      heads, one facing up and the other down, that moved both horizontally between a pair of adjacent platters and
      vertically from one pair of platters to a second set.
</p>

<p>
      A <b>hard disk drive (HDD)</b>, <b>hard disk</b>, <b>hard drive</b>, or <b>fixed disk</b>, is an electro-mechanical data storage device
      that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage with one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters
      coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator
      arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning
      that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. <b>HDDs</b> are a type of non-volatile storage,
      retaining stored data when powered off. Modern <b>HDDs</b> are typically in the form of a small rectangular box.

      The first computer to defeat a human in chess was IBM’s Deep Blue in <b>1997</b>.
</p>

<p>
      Deep Blue was a chess-playing expert system run on a unique purpose-built IBM supercomputer. It was the first
      computer to win a game, and the first to win a match, against a reigning world champion under regular time
      controls.

      <h3> A Real?! Bug</h3>
    </section>
    <p>
      The first computer bug was a real insect that got trapped in a computer relay in <b>1947</b>.
</p>

<p>
      A software bug is an error, flaw or fault in the design, development, or operation of computer software that
      causes it to produce an <i>incorrect</i> or <i>unexpected</i> result, or to behave in <i>unintended</i> ways. The process of finding
      and correcting bugs is termed "<i>debugging</i>" and often uses formal techniques or tools to pinpoint bugs. Since the
      1950s, some computer systems have been designed to detect or auto-correct various software errors during
      operations.
</p>

<p>
      The term "<i>bug</i>" was used in an account by computer pioneer Grace Hopper, who publicized the cause of a malfunction
      in an early electromechanical computer.
</p>

<p>
      Operators traced an error in the Mark II to a moth trapped in a relay, coining the term <i>bug</i>. This bug was
      carefully removed and taped to the log book. Stemming from the first bug, today we call errors or glitches in a
      program a <i>bug</i>.
</p>

<p>
      The operators who found it, including William "Bill" Burke, later of the Naval Weapons Laboratory, Dahlgren,
      Virginia, were familiar with the engineering term and amusedly kept the insect with the notation "<i>First actual
      case of bug being found.</i>" This log book, complete with attached moth, is part of the collection of the Smithsonian
      National Museum of American History.
